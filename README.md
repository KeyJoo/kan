# Kan

Simple functional authorization library for ruby. Inspired by [transproc](https://github.com/solnic/transproc)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kan'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kan

## Usage

```ruby
class Post::Abilities
  include Kan::Abilities

  register 'read' { |_, _| true }
  register 'edit' { |user, post| user.id == post.user_id }
  register 'delete' { |_, _| false }
end

# register more than one ability in one place
class Post::AdminAbilities
  include Kan::Abilities

  register :read, :edit, :delete { |user, _| user.admin? }
end

class Comments::Abilities
  include Kan::Abilities

  register 'read' { |_, _| true }
  register 'edit' { |user, _| user.admin? }

  register :delete do |user, comment|
    user.id == comment.user_id && comment.created_at < Time.now + TEN_MINUTES
  end
end

abilities = Kan::Application.new(
  post: Post::Abilities.new,
  comment: Comments::Abilities.new,
)

abilities['post.read'].call(current_user, post) # => true
abilities['post.delete'].call(current_user, post) # => false

abilities['comment.delete'].call(current_user, post) # => false

# Default ability eq `proc { true }`
abilities['comment.invalid'].call(current_user, post) # => true

# But you can rewrite default ability block
admin_abilities = Kan::Application.new(
  post: Post::AdminAbilities.new(default_ability_block: proc { false}),
  comment: Comments::Abilities.new,
)

admin_abilities['post.delete'].call(current_user, post) # => false
admin_abilities['post.delete'].call(admin_user, post) # => true
admin_abilities['post.invalid'].call(current_user, post) # => false

global_abilities = Kan::Application.new(
  post: [Post::Abilities.new, Post::AdminAbilities.new],
  comment: Comments::Abilities.new,
)

global_abilities['post.edit'].call(current_user, post) # => false
global_abilities['post.edit'].call(owner_user, post) # => true
global_abilities['post.edit'].call(admin_user, post) # => true
```

### Dry-auto\_inject
```ruby
AbilitiesImport = Dry::AutoInject(Kan::Application.new({}))

# Operation

class UpdateOperation
  include AbilitiesImport[ability_checker: 'post.edit']

  def call(user, params)
    return Left(:permission_denied) unless ability_checker.call(user)
    # ...
  end
end

# Specs

UpdateOperation.new(ability_checker: ->(*) { true })
UpdateOperation.new(ability_checker: ->(*) { false })
```
